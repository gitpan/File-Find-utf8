NAME

    File::Find::utf8 - Fully UTF-8 aware File::Find

VERSION

    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        # Use the utf-8 versions of find and finddepth
        use File::Find::utf8;
        find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Revert back to non-utf-8 versions
        no File::Find::utf8;
        finddepth(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Export only the find function
        use File::Find::utf8 qw(find);
        find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
    
        # Export no functions
        use File::Find::utf8 qw(:none); # NOT "use File::Find::utf8 qw();"!
        File::Find::find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);

DESCRIPTION

    While the original File::Find functions are capable of handling UTF-8
    quite well, they expect and return all data as bytes, not as
    characters.

    This module replaces the File::Find functions with fully UTF-8 aware
    versions, both expecting and returning characters.

    Note: Replacement of functions is not done on Win32, DOS, and OS/2 as
    these systems do not have full UTF-8 file system support.

 Behaviour

    The module behaves as a pragma so you can use both use File::Find::utf8
    and no File::Find::utf8 to turn utf-8 support on or off.

    By default, both find() and finddepth() are exported (as with the
    original File::Find), if you want to prevent this, use use
    File::Find::utf8 qw(:none). (As all the magic happens in the module's
    import function, you can not simply use use File::Find::utf8 qw())
